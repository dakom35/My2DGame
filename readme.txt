This is a project to learn how to make 'simple' games in C++ with the SFML library
The goal is to "shoot" the rectangles popping on the screen : a good aim warm-up.


 This is the command to compile and generate the executable game file : 

g++ -o My2DGame main.cpp Game.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
